# Text-Classification-With-TensorFlow
This Project classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using the text of the review. This is an example of binary, or two-class, classification - a widely applicable type of machine learning problem.

It uses the **IMDB dataset** that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database. These are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are balanced, meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

This project uses **Keras**, a high-level API to build and train models in **TensorFlow**, and **tensorflow_hub**, a library for loading trained models from **TFHub** in a single line of code.
